The attached code has a delay “time_nanosleep(0,500000000);” introduced to simulate processing and has introduced a vulnerability allowing an end-user to bruit force the password by analysing the web applications response time to various inputs.
Objective:

    To determine the Password without looking at the code.
    Rewrite the code to mitigate against this side channel attack. Your code solution should have the same processing time irrespective of the password provided by the end user.
    Use your notes/slides “09 Side Channel Vulnerability” for a potential solution.
